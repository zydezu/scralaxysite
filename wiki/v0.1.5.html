    <p>0.1.5 was a version of Super Mario Scralaxy developed by Pickledodeon. It was released on 11th June 2017.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>0.1.5 was the first version to add fully illustrated level designs. This was significant to the game's progress, since only black platforms were used in the version prior.</p>
    <p>0.1.5 was originally developed and uploaded by Pickledodeon, but was later delisted for unknown reasons. The one currently available is a slightly altered version uploaded 
      by GlobeyTheGlove, which replaced the Super Mario 64-esque health bar with an original one, which resembles Super Mario Galaxy's closely.</p>

    <h2>Changelog</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Waluigi no longer gets stuck on slopes</li>
      <li>Switching character is less annoying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>Very little is known about the original version, so all information comes from the reupload made by GlobeyTheGlove.</p>
    <p>The general reception seemed to be overall positive and similar to other versions, saying that it was shaping up nicely, or issuing bugs. 
      However, Pickleodeon did note that they did not personally like the change of the health bar in the reupload, since the game was not made as a remake of Super Mario Galaxy, but rather a 2D imagining of Super Mario 64 and Sunshine.</p>
