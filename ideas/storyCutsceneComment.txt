I feel like we need some more cutscenes or story in the Scralaxy game. Maybe we should have a plan (eg: floor 3 - more story is revealed/conflict between heros and villains).

	- I was thinking of doing a short intro cutscene for each boss to hint as to how to defeal it after I got a few comments on 0.4.8 asking how to defeat Giant Spearhead 	Maybe we could add a few story elements in those, especially the end-of-floor ones (Bowser Jr, Triclyde, Bowser, Snifberg, and the final boss fights)? Although some 	more ordinary story cutscenes could work too.
