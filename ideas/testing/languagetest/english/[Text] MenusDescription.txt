Mario¶¬Mario is the main character of the game. His jumps aren't high, but they aren't low either. Same for his speed. He's good with beginners.¬
Luigi¶¬Luigi is Mario's twin brother. He can jump quite a bit higher than Mario. After overcoming his fear, he is ready for a new adventure!¬
Stefano¶¬Stefano is Mario and Luigi's long lost third brother. He was lost in a far away galaxy for years, but was rescued by a woman in a blue dress and is now ready for a new adventure!¬
Wario¶¬Wario's not the fastest, but he is pretty powerful! His weight might even help him get to secret areas... and nab that gold!¬
Waluigi¶¬Waluigi time! Waluigi is super fast and a good swimmer. He's also just awesome, I mean... who doesn't like a strange skinny man with a pointy moustache yelling 'WAH' all the time?¬
Wafano¶¬His family relationship with Wario and Waluigi is unknown... He can jump high, run at an average speed and is able to perform a powerful kick attack!¬
Captain Toad¶¬The leader of the Toad Brigade is joining the adventure! Usually he's unable to jump, but with his new hover springboard, he can get around with ease!¬
Shell Pong¶¬A flying shell bounces around the stage. You need it to bounce it using your paddle as many times as you can! Use the arrow keys to move Mario.¬
Toad Pong¶¬The classic table tennis game pong, but with Toads! Blue Toad uses the arrow keys and Yellow Toad uses WASD. The Toads cannot jump, so work together!¬
Stefano Fly¶¬Stefano has grabbed a Red Star, so he can fly! Use the up and down arrow keys to move and collect coins to increase your score. If you miss one, it will reset.¬
Find Luigi¶¬Luigi is hiding on the screen somewhere... click or tap his quickly to score the most points, but be careful to not click on anything else!¬
Paratroopa Hunt¶¬Click the flying Paratroopas to zap them. If you zap something else, or let the Paratroopas fly away, it's game over!¬
