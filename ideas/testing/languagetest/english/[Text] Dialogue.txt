⊗-SUPER MARIO SCRALAXY-⊗ ¶A History...¶¶Use ¬arrows and Z¬ to ¬select an option¬.
¬Super Mario Scralaxy¬ is the first game by the ¬Scralaxy Team¬, development was started by ®Pickleodeon® on ¬21st May 2017¬...
The name ¬"Scralaxy Team"¬ was used later. While ¬initially¬ there was ¬no official group name¬, with the group ¬referring to itself¬ simply as ¬"Super Mario Scralaxy"¬, ¬"SMS"¬ or ¬"Team Pickelodeon"¬.
Although ®Pickleodeon® ¬stopped development¬ on the game ¬later that year¬, the ¬rest of the team¬ continued to ¬develop the game¬.
The game was ¬not planned¬ to be a fan game of ¬Super Mario Galaxy¬, but more a ¬culmination¬ of ¬past 3D Mario games¬.
"Now that we have the physics engine all worked out  we should start level design. This will be an exploration based game like Mario 64..." - ¬An old studio comment from ¬®Pickleodeon®
In the ¬early development¬ of the game, ¬updates¬ were ¬released quickly¬ and there were ¬many experimental features¬ at the time.
Many ¬sprites and assets¬ were ¬drawn at this point¬, with many being from ®Misterythefox13®, who developed the ¬original art-style characters in the game¬ possess.
¬Most sprites¬ were initially in a ¬bitmap¬ format, with them all eventually being ¬redrawn as vector sprites¬ later on.
A ¬scrolling version¬ of the game was tested early, but it was ¬decided it was too laggy/buggy¬ at that point. A ¬scrolling engine¬ would be ¬implemented 5 years¬ later by ¬ToadFanSchool¬.
¬Around v0.3.0s release¬, ®Pickleodeon® ¬announced¬ that he was "stepping down as the lead dev of [the] project." and that ¬everything else¬ would be up to ¬the decision¬ of the ¬remaining members¬.
A bit after this, a ¬"dibs"¬ project was made by ®DoritoDude123® to ¬organise who was making planned updates¬. Here ¬project members¬ could ¬claim updates¬, signifying they would be ¬developing that update¬.
On the ¬5th August 2018¬, the ®ScralaxyTeam® account was ¬created¬, giving a space to ¬organise various resources¬, such as the ¬idea vault¬.
Around the ¬24th August 2018¬, the ¬Scralaxy Team 'Fandom' Wiki¬ was created, ¬documenting¬ the entire ¬Scralaxy Team¬ and ¬their games¬.
¬Version 0.5.0¬ was released on ¬15th September 2018¬, marking the halfway point of the development of ¬Super Mario Scralaxy¬!
¬Around 2021¬ the ¬updates seemed to stagnate¬. The cause of this is not clear, but can be attributed to ¬members moving on from Scratch¬,¬life getting busier¬ or ¬updates taking longer¬... ¬Super Mario Scralaxy¬ was in ¬limbo¬.
¬Luckily¬ around the ¬end of 2021¬, several ¬team members¬ returned to the project to ¬continue developing updates¬...
...and at this ¬present day¬ updates continue...
